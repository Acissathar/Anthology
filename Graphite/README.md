# Prowl.Graphite

A cross-platform, low-level graphics and compute abstraction for .NET, with a Vulkan backend. Graphite powers the rendering layer of the Prowl Game Engine and can be used to build high-performance 2D and 3D games, simulations, tools, and other graphical applications.

Graphite started life as a modified and butchered version of NeoVeldrid, and by extension Veldrid, but has diverged far enough in its setup and API surface that it is now considered a separate library rather than a fork. There would be an API difference page, but there's not a lot left. However, some heritage remains regarding the texture/buffer API and some of the command buffer internals.

## Features

- A Vulkan backend, with macOS support via MoltenVK (Vulkan-over-Metal translation).
- A monolithic `ShaderProgram` model that bundles shader and pipeline state, with per-backend shader compilation handled internally.
- A string/id-driven `PropertySet` resource binding system that hides per-backend binding rules.
- A declarative render graph (`RenderPipeline`, `IPass`) that orders passes from their
  declared texture and buffer reads/writes and resolves shared, transient, and history resources
  automatically.
- A frame-less `ExecutionTask` ring for CPU/GPU synchronization, with per-execution transient
  (bump-allocated) GPU memory.
- Runtime-toggleable validation through `GraphicsDeviceOptions`, and per-execution profilers.

## Requirements

- .NET 10 (`net10.0`).
- A GPU and driver supporting Vulkan.
- [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) 2.23.0 (pulled in transitively; provides the native bindings).
- [Prowl.Vector](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prowl.Vector) 2.1.0 for vector and matrix math.

## Quick Start

Rendering is built around a render graph: a `RenderPipeline` owns a list of `IPass`es, and a
`GraphicsDevice` dispatches that pipeline against a list of views. The simplest possible pipeline is one
pass that writes the view target, which presents the frame when the view's `Target` is a swapchain framebuffer:

```cs
internal readonly struct SceneView : IRenderView
{
    public SceneView(uint width, uint height, Swapchain swapchain)
    {
        PixelWidth = width;
        PixelHeight = height;
        Target = swapchain.Framebuffer;
    }

    public uint PixelWidth { get; }
    public uint PixelHeight { get; }
    public int ViewId => 0;
    public Framebuffer Target { get; }
}

internal sealed class TrianglePass : RasterPass
{
    private readonly Mesh _triangle;
    private readonly GraphicsProgram _shader;

    public TrianglePass(Mesh triangle, GraphicsProgram shader)
    {
        _triangle = triangle;
        _shader = shader;
    }

    public override string Name => "Triangle";

    public override void Setup(RenderContextBuilder builder) => SetViewTarget(builder, TargetLoadStoreOps.Clear(new Color(0.10f, 0.12f, 0.16f, 1.0f)));

    public override void Render(RenderContext context, CommandBuffer cmd)
    {
        BindTarget(context, cmd);
        cmd.SetShader(_shader);
        cmd.SetVertexSource(_triangle);
        cmd.DrawIndexed();

    }
}
```

Creating a device and dispatching the pipeline each frame:

```cs
GraphicsDeviceOptions options = new()
{
    VulkanValidationLayers = false,
};

SwapchainDescription swapchainDescription = new()
{
    Source = SwapchainSource.CreateVulkan(window.VkSurface!),
    Width = (uint)window.FramebufferSize.X,
    Height = (uint)window.FramebufferSize.Y,
    DepthFormat = PixelFormat.D24_UNorm_S8_UInt,
    SyncToVerticalBlank = false
};

GraphicsDevice device = GraphicsDevice.CreateVulkan(options, swapchainDescription, vulkanOptions);

GraphicsProgram shader = /* load + create a ShaderProgram */;
Mesh triangle = /* create vertex/index buffers */;
RenderPipeline pipeline = new([new TrianglePass(triangle, shader)]);
SceneView[] views = { new SceneView(600, 600, device.MainSwapchain) };

// Per-frame render loop: builds an ExecutionTask internally, runs the pipeline for every view, and
// presents the swapchain of every view that wrote the view target.
device.DispatchGraph(pipeline, views);
```

The [`Samples/`](Samples) directory contains complete, runnable versions of this and larger graphs
(window creation, shader loading, and mesh setup included).

## Backends

| Backend       | Windows | Linux | macOS |
|---------------|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Vulkan        | Yes     | Yes   | Yes (via MoltenVK) |

A device is created through the backend-specific factory methods on `GraphicsDevice`
(`CreateVulkan`). The `GraphicsBackend` enum enumerates the available backends.

## Building

The solution targets `net10.0`. Build everything with:

```sh
dotnet build Prowl.Graphite.slnx
```

### Build configuration flags

One MSBuild property controls backend trimming. It can be set on the command line
(`-p:ExcludeVulkan=true`) or in `Directory.Build.props`.

| Property        | Default | Effect                                                                                                      |
|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ExcludeVulkan` | `false` | Excludes the Vulkan backend (and its Silk.NET packages) from the build, defining `EXCLUDE_VULKAN_BACKEND`. |

## Validation and Profiling

**Validation** (`GraphicsDeviceOptions.GraphiteValidation`, defaults to true) adds argument and
state checks that throw descriptive exceptions on misuse. It lives under `Graphite/ValidationLayers`,
mirroring `Graphite/Core` and `Graphite/Platform`, and is read once at device creation. Leave it on
during development and disable it for release builds.

**Counters** (`GraphicsDevice.Counters`) are always on: live allocations, resident buffer bytes,
barriers, swaps, buffer operations and set binds. Read them with `Counters.Snapshot()`.

**Profilers** observe exactly one execution each. Pass them to the execution directly:

```csharp
Recording recording = new(device);
device.DispatchGraph(pipeline, views, recording);
recording.Wait();
```

An execution started with no profilers creates one from each `GraphicsDevice.GlobalProfilers`
factory, so a factory can collect a profiler per frame, or return null to skip a frame and sample:

```csharp
device.GlobalProfilers.Add(() => new MyFrameProfiler(results));
```

A profiler gets `BeginExecution(executionId, graphName)`, then the events of each capability it
implements (`IGraphProfiler`, `IGpuStatsProfiler`, `ICaptureProfiler`, `ICommandStreamProfiler`), then
`EndExecution()` once every GPU result is delivered. The graph name is `RenderPipeline.Name`, which
defaults to the pipeline type name; `BeginExecution(name, ...)` names executions without a graph.
A capability with one profiler calls it directly; several profilers sharing a capability are merged
for that capability only. Execution ids grow with start order, so per-execution results sort by id.

There is no profiling for `device.Record` or other transfers outside an execution.

`Graphite.Debugger` builds on this seam: `Recording` captures views, passes and GPU timings,
`DeepRecording` also captures commands and resource copies, and `Replayer` replays a recorded pass
on any device.

## Samples

Runnable samples live under [`Samples/`](Samples) and share common setup (windowing, shader and
model loading) through the `Shared` project:

- `HelloTriangle` - the minimal render loop: one pass writing the view target, no offscreen passes.
- `TexturedQuad` - texture and sampler binding.
- `Cube` / `CubeGrid` - 3D transforms and instancing-style draws.
- `PBRRenderer` - a multi-pass render graph: an offscreen "Scene" pass, a two-step bloom
  (downsample/upsample), and a composite pass that writes Scene + bloom to the view target. The
  graph orders the four passes from their declared texture reads/writes.

Run one with, for example:

```sh
dotnet run --project Samples/HelloTriangle
```

## Testing

Tests live under [`Tests/`](Tests) and are split into CPU tests (pure value-type tests, run in
parallel) and GPU tests (which share one device per backend and run serialized). GPU shaders are
authored in GLSL (`.glsl`) under `Tests/Graphite/Shaders` and compiled to SPIR-V for Vulkan at runtime
by the ShaderDef GLSL compiler. There are no checked-in compiled shaders.
See [`Tests/README.md`](Tests/README.md) for the current suite layout and the in-progress
migration of older suites onto the `GraphicsProgram` / `PropertySet` / `ExecutionTask` API.

```sh
dotnet test Tests/Prowl.Graphite.Tests.csproj
```

Thank you to mellinoe and ciberman, the creators of
[Veldrid](https://github.com/veldrid/veldrid) and
[NeoVeldrid](https://github.com/jhm-ciberman/neo-veldrid), for being unaware of what I did to your
libraries. Having a base, known-stable library has massively boosted development and shaved hours
of boilerplate off development time.

Prowl.Graphite has had radical filesystem and API changes relative to upstream Veldrid/NeoVeldrid.
As such, changes and fixes from NeoVeldrid cannot be easily merged, and will land in the commit
history with the prefix `(NeoVeldrid)` and the same commit name, but with altered file paths,
locations, and logic. If any of the original contributors would like more or different credit for
their work, or would like me to stop sourcing from their commits, please reach out.
